#Twitter Haiku Bot

A modification of my old haiku bot to check Trump's spelling

Make sure to install Tweepy before running!

```python
pip install tweepy
```

After that, its as simple as setting up a config.py file like so
```python
consumer_key = "XXXXXXXX"
consumer_secret = "XXXXXXXX"
access_token = "XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX"
access_token_secret = "XXXXXXXX"
```

and then running `python trumpspellchecker.py`
